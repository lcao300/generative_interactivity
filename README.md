# Generative interactivity

## About this project

At its core, data science revolves around analyzing and presenting data in a visually pleasing way. The driving force behind this project was to take our everyday interactions with our computers and to reimagine those interactions as real-time art pieces. Each part of this project maps different computer input parameters into generative art. 

I hope that this project will reveal some interesting aspects about:
1. the way we interact with the online world 
2. how our emotions are intertwined with our digital life
3. the method in which our computers can sometimes act as invasive vectors with the powerful capacity to collect massive amounts of information about our real selves through our virtual experiences

### Microphone

Whether it's keyboard clicks or a background TV show, we are not always aware of the sounds that exist around us when we are on the computer. [This piece](https://lcao300.github.io/generative_interactivity/fft_visualizer) uses raw microphone input, and after some processing, converts time-based audio data into frequency-based visual data.

### Keyboard

As we may all know too well, sometimes it's easier to reveal emotionally charged information through the computer keybaord rather than through in-person interactions. [This piece](https://lcao300.github.io/generative_interactivity/sentimentflow) asks participants to write about their day. From that writing, the code extracts sentiment data and time/date information to create a unique generated image â€” every image is different and cannot be reproduced, essentially storing the emotions at that point in time. 

### Camera

When we are online, the content that is served to us can sway our emotions in a variety of ways, and were our cameras to be on, it would capture a rainbow of facial expressions. [This piece](https://lcao300.github.io/generative_interactivity/face_blob) takes camera input and offers participants a relaxing experience based on feedback from facial expression recognition. 

### Arrow keys

It doesn't always seem like it, but our existence in the online space is an exploration of a world divorced from the physical one. [This piece](https://lcao300.github.io/generative_interactivity/parallax) builds a world around color and sound, and gives the reader a stakes-free way to explore this world. Read the instructions carefully!
